# How to setup
### 1. Extends from `StoreSO`
Override at least abstract method. You should take of saving your data in persistent memory. There are basic methods required to implement in the example below.
```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Sirenix.Serialization;
using UnityEngine;
using UniRx;
using Project.Store;
using BigInt = System.Numerics.BigInteger;

[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "MyStore", menuName = "Store/MyStore")]
public class MyStore : StoreSO
{
    [OdinSerialize, NonSerialized]
    public ReactiveProperty<BigInt> balance = new ReactiveProperty<BigInt>();

    public override IObservable<Price> OnBalanceChanged(string currency)
    {
        return balance.Select(x => new Price(currency, x));
    }

    public override BigInt GetBalance(string currency)
    {
        return balance.Value;
    }

    protected override void SpendBalance(string currency, BigInt amount)
    {
        balance.Value -= amount;
    }
    protected override void ApplyPurchase(List<IStoreSellable> sellables)
    {
        // Apply purchase here
    }
}
```
### 2. Create instance of the new ScriptableObject `MyStore`
Create instance and do setup. You can add as many currencies as needed. Also you can use it without currencies at all, if you just need to handle in-app purchases.

# How to show sellable item(s) in UI

This system is quite independent, but you need to show sellable items for a user, to make ability for a user to buy them. There are multiple ways to do that.

- create prefab for drawing UI element which represent single item for selling. If you need you can use multiple prefabs for different reasons in different places
- add `StoreSellableDrawer_UGUI` component to the prefab
- bind all required elements to the component

It can be used for showing single sellable item.

## Adapters
Adapter generates multiples items, very easy to setup all of them from single place with small amount of setup steps.

- `StoreCategoryAdapter` - shows list of sellable items from specific category
- `StoreCustomAdapter` - shows custom list of sellable items
- Or create your own StoreAdapter, for that need to extand from `StoreAdapter`. Also you may create custom StoreSellableDrawer for any UI system in case if you don't use Unity UI.

# How to show separate price of specific sellable item

That is easy. Just create any gameObject with Text component and add `PriceDrawer` on it.

- to restore non-consumable in-app purchases use `SimpleInAppPurchaseRestorer`
